# rgb_dreamlight
Arduino code for operating RGB Dreamlight using a microphone as input

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3641479

I modified the case top and bottom to accommodate adding an electret microphone amplifier and a female barrel jack for power to the original design. All hardware is inside the case (Arduino Nano, a capacitor, a resistor, the microphone, and wiring. Used hot glue to hold everything together and M3-0.5 x 6mm cap screws to secure the base.

I also used a quick disconnect plug for power to the Nano so I can program it from USB if I need to while keeping the LED matrix powered.

I am including the code I wrote to control the LEDs. I wrote in about a half dozen variations for how the matrix will light up. My code isn't commented very well but there isn't much there so shouldn't be difficult to figure out. Also has some code in it from Adafruit to measure sound levels.
